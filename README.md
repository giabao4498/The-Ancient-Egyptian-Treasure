## Storyline:
The world has many unsolved mysteries, especially about the ancient Egypt. One of the biggest mysteries is hidden in the ancient Tutankhamun's tomb. Many people lost their lives trying to find it. It is said to contain a deadly curse that no one entering the pyramid could come back alive.

But nothing can stop me. I do not believe in superstitions. I must find the hidden treasure by all cost. Adventure is in my blood. And I will go down in history as the first to unravel this mystery.

Stepping to the pyramid, I feel a dark aura. Something is watching me! It is coming closer! I wonder what it is. What a stinky smell!

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

## Tutorial:
Move your explorer with the arrow keys (if you are using computer), or by clicking on the arrow buttons.

Notice that the mummy moved after you! In the darkness of the pyramid, it can move twice as fast as you. Careful!

You have to use the maze walls to trap and confuse the mummy if you want to escape. The mummy always tries to take a direct path to you. The walls will block it.

Sometimes the best move is no move at all. You can pass your turn with the `space` key (if you are using computer), or by clicking on the "PASS TURN" button. The mummy then moves as normal.

The white mummy will always try to move closer to you ***horizontally before it moves in the vertical direction***.

The red mummy does the opposite, moving ***vertically first, then horizontally***.

Sometimes a locked gate will bar your progress.

When you see such a gate, look for a key nearby.

Stepping on it will open or close the gate. Remember that the gate can be triggered by ***either you or the mummy***.

When you see a skull tile, be careful!

That is a trap left by the pharaohs to guard their pyramids. Stepping on a skull tile will spell instant doom for your explorer!

But remember, ***the mummy can cross over a skull tile without harm***.

You can use the "UNDO MOVE" and "RESET MAZE" buttons at any time.

***Undo Move*** takes back your last action. Clicking it multiple times will step you back to the start of the level. ***Reset Maze*** does just that, restarting the maze with you and the mummy in your original position.

Keep an eye on the Ankh in the top right of the map.

If it is ***yellow***, the explorer is still alive. But if it turns ***grey***, that means the explorer is done.

You will need to undo a move or reset the maze.

The pyramid has `15` chambers. The final one contains an ancient Egyptian treasure!

If you solve the 15th maze, you will grab the treasure and win the game.
